# MODULE 1 CHALLENGE - PayZen

## Overview and Origin:

* Name of company
    - Payzen
* When was the company incorporated?
    - Payzen was incorporated mid 2019.
* Who are the founders of the company?
    - Founders include: 
        - Ariel Rosenthal, CTO
        - Itzik Cohen, CEO
        - Tobian Mezger, COO/CFO
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
    - The company is driven to address the healthcare affordability crisis that impacts millions of Americans today. The mission of this company is to a positive impact on the healthcare affordability market and improve the lives of patients and providers.
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
    - The company has gone through two seed rounds and a Series A round of funding. In total, the company has raised roughly $20 million.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - Oddly enough, Payzen has the ability to address both sides of the healthcare payment experience. Most importantly, Payzen wants to improve patient affordability of healthcare services. The rising use of High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP) is complicated further by the fact that most Americans can’t afford emergency expenses that exceed a few hundred dollars. 
    
        Additionally, patient financing that is easy to use and accessible to many may also increase the likelihood that providers are able to collect on the bills they issue. In today’s environment, providers may only collect 50 cents on the dollar billed to patients. Furthermore, the ability to reduce the expense associated with paper processing is significant as well.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    - The intended customer is addressed above. The estimated value of the patient payment market is $3 trillion dollars annually, so the opportunity to improve the experience and capture a portion of that transaction volume is high.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    - Payzen’s differentiator is its ability to offer different repayment terms based on the ingested patient details. There is little detail published concerning how the Payzen weights the inputs and displays the repayment options for the patient.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    -   Payzen's programming stack includes:
        - JavaScript
        - Node.js
        - React.js


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    - Payzen sits within the healthcare payments fintech category.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    - Within this category, new entrants are focused on providing digital payment experiences that leverage data from 837 and 835 data to track patient accountability and service details. Additionally, machine learning technologies are allowing service providers to offer 0%, short-duration loans to patients allowing the repayment of certain medical expenses over a twelve month period rather than in a single payment.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    - Other companies in this area include: Instamed, Cedar, Walnut, Wellpay. 


## Results:

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    - Payzen has improved patients' ability to repay otherwise unaffordable medical bills.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
- The primary metric used by businesses like PayZen is improved patient collection percentages. PayZen says their solution has driven a 30% increase in patient collections for providers. ALthough this is a provider driven metric, it speaks to PayZen's ability to improve affordability among patients because of the collections lift. 

    Another measure used within this industry is time to repay and default rate. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, most companies (including PayZen) do not publish this information.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    - PayZen's performance is in-line with other players in this market. One comparable is Cedar. Cedar provides a similar solution although their risk calculation related to patient payments is different, and Cedar's collection improvement is about 25%. Outperforming both Cedar and PayZen, Wellpay boasts a partnership that resulted in a 45% increase in patient collections.


## Recommendations:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - I would suggest PayZen consider offering short-term lending solutions to the providers they serve currently. Given the insight they have on patient responsibility, and overall repayment, PayZen likely would have a great opporutnity to forecast future revenue and for the provider and lend against that forecast.  
    
      I would also suggest PayZen look at offering health savings accounts or integrating with existing HSA administrators. Given the high percentage of consumers with HDHPs, many of those consumers also have (or are eligible to have) a health savings account. The new health savings account, coupled with insight regarding medical spending habits may allow PayZen to make recommendations concerning how many an individual should put in their HSA on a regular basis to cover emergency medical expenses.
    

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - If PayZen offered short-term providing lending services, they would be able to collect revenue on both sides of the exchange - the consumer when they repay their medical bill and from the provider who would pay interest on the loaned amount. Diversifying their income would reduce the risk exposure to a delcine in consumer payments.
    
        In terms of the benefit behind offering an HSA, it's simply an opportunity to make the repayment experience easier for consumers given their funds used to repay the medical bill may be more easily accessible.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - To issue a provider lending solution PayZen would be able to use their existing machine learning structure with additional, provider specific, inputs.

        They may also benefit from payment technology used by Plaid or Stripe. With Plaid's API connections, PayZen may be able to quickly validate bank account information and facilitate payment to the provider while limiting their risk of fraud losses.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - These technologies are necessary to analyze lending risk and facilitate rapid payments with limited risk.
